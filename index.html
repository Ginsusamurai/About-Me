        <main>
            <p>I am a veteran of the United States Marine Corps. I am also an aspiring developer. 
            This journey began around 2012 when I was working as a marekting director. I began tinkering with a few pages here and there. 
            Later, in 2014, I started my own company. It was a live online binary options trading company. I assisted with the first website,
            but after being completely dissatisfied with the results, I built our second itteration myself. Truth be told, I did use a CMS,
            but I used a basic template and built the rest of of the site from there. I was pretty proud of it actually. It had several pages
            on the public facing side, as well as a protected membership side of the site on a subdomain. I ran this company successfully for 2 years 
            before the laws changed and we decided to close the site.
            </p>
            <p>Development isn't my only passion. I enjoy a good walk through nature. Some call that hiking, but I don't require it to be a big workout to enjoy nature.
            I also love sports. Well, I love my teams. I don't like yours. :P <br>
            I find joy in using wood, cement, and other mediums to express creativity. This can be as simple as a set of coasters, a cutting board, etc
            to coffee tables, shelves, stools, and other furniture or decorations. I think it is great to be able to have a physical outlet as well as a digital one.
            I would also love to get my pilot's licence someday.
            </p>
            <p>I became a vegetarian about 2 years ago. I tried going vegan almost 4 years ago. I actually did really well with it for a few months, 
                but I had NO idea what I was doing, so I wasn't getting enough nutrients. So after 6 months of research and keeping some foods phased out,
                I finally cut out my last bit of meat and haven't looked back. I feel better than I ever have in my entire life. With that said, I am of course an animal lover. I have had cats, dogs, hamsters, birds, fish, turtles, you name it as a pet before. I would love to one day have a place with plenty of land and have a safe place for all sorts of animals, including llamas. First of all, they look cool. Seondly, that word is just fun to say.
